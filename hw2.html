<br>I am a LA native with a heart for code. I use code to create new platforms for expression, creativity, or communication. I am excited to use my passion to bring your vision to life. <br>

<br>
 I recently graduated from General Assembly’s Front End Web Development Program in the Fall. Before I started coding, I launched a career in finance.<br>

<br>I am currently working as a financial analyst. I previously studied at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. I was able to graduate at the age of 18 with a degree in Finance. <br>
